ASP.NET Core client web browser detection extension to resolve devices, platforms, engine of the client.

ASP.NET Core Responsive middleware for routing base upon request client device detection to specific view


![ASP.NET Core Responsive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wangkanai/Detection/dev/asset/aspnet-core-detection-2.svg?sanitize=true)


## Installation

Installation of detection library is now done with a single package reference point.

```powershell
PM> install-package Wangkanai.Detection -pre
```

Installation of Responsive library will bring in all dependency packages (This will include `Wangkanai.Detection.Device).

```powershell
PM> install-package Wangkanai.Responsive -pre
```

## Configuration

This library host the component to resolve the access client device type.

Implement of the library into your web application is done by configuring the `Startup.cs` by adding the detection service in the `ConfigureServices` method.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	// Add detection services container and device resolver service.
    services.AddDetection();

    // Add framework services.
    services.AddMvc();
}
```

* `AddDetection()` Adds the detection services to the services container.

Responsive is configured in the `ConfigureServices` method:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Add responsive services.
    services.AddResponsive();

    // Add framework services.
    services.AddMvc();  
}
```

* `AddResponsive()` Adds the Responsive services to the services container.

  * **Suffix** Ex `*views/[controller]/[action]/index.mobile.cshtml*`
  * **SubFoler** Ex `*views/[controller]/[action]/mobile/index.cshtml*`

While the detection service is configured globally, its can also be configure individually if you only need some functions.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Add detection services container and device resolver service.
    services.AddDetectionCore()
        .AddDevice()
        .AddBrowser()
        .AddPlatform()  // concept
        .AddEngine()    // concept
        .AddCrawler();

    // Add framework services.
    services.AddMvc();
}
```

* `AddDetectionCore()` Adds the detection services to the services container.
* `AddDevice()` Adds the device resolver service to the detection core services builder.
* `AddBrowser()` Adds the browser resolver service to the detection core services builder.
* `AddPlatform()` Adds the platform resolver service to the detection core services builder.
* `AddEngine()` Adds the engine resolver service to the detection core services builder.
* `AddCrawler()` Adds the crawler resolver service to the detection core services builder.

Or you could be more specific using the `AddResponsiveCore()` method:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Add responsive services.
    services.AddResponsiveCore()
        .AddViewSuffix()
        .AddViewSubfolder();

    // Add framework services.
    services.AddMvc();  
}
```

* `AddResponsiveCore()` Adds the Responsive services to the services container.
* `AddViewSuffix()` Adds support for device view files  to `Suffix`. In this sample view Responsive is based on the view file suffix. 

  Ex `*views/[controller]/[action]/index.mobile.cshtml*`

* `AddViewSubfolder()` Adds support for device view files to `Subfolder`. In this sample view Responsive is based on the view file subfolder. 

  Ex `*views/[controller]/[action]/mobile/index.cshtml*`

## Configure Middleware

The current device on a request is set in the Responsive middleware. The Responsive middleware is enabled in the `Configure` method of *Startup.cs* file.

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
{
    app.UseResponsive();

    app.UseMvc(routes =>
    {
        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "default",
            template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });
}
```

## Global Resolver (beta8)

This library host the component to resolve all the access client related resolver that could resolve.

Example of calling the detection service in the `Controller` using dependency injection.

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IDetection _detection;

    public HomeController(IDetection detection)
    {
        _detection = detection;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View(_detection);
    }
}
```
* `IDetection` is main service for you to access detection service.

When the `Detection` is pass to the view you can render results like the following example.

```html
@model Wangkanai.Detection.Detection

<h3>UserAgent</h3>
<code>@Model.UserAgent</code>

<h3>Results</h3>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Resolver</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Version</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Device</th>
            <td>@Model.Device?.Type.ToString()</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Browser</th>
            <td>@Model.Browser?.Type.ToString()</td>
            <td>@Model.Browser?.Version</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <td>@Model.Platform?.Type.ToString()</td>
            <td>@Model.Platform?.Version</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Engine</th>
            <td>@Model.Engine?.Type.ToString()</td>
            <td>@Model.Engine?.Version</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Crawler</th>
            <td>@Model.Crawler?.Type.ToString()</td>
            <td>@Model.Crawler?.Version</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
